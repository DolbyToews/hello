# The Experimental program is far more simplistic than the Master Program: It operates without an interaction matrix and only has the option to choose between single and multiple occupancy.
# There is only one new input that isn't in the Master Program: The Energy Barrier input. You can place an energy barrier at any Y-level, though it is reccommended to place it within the cell membrane.
# This energy barrier is uncrossable to particles except under certain circumstances, but ultimately, it leads to the system being able to pump particles in the same fashion as a symporter.
# The system outputs graphs of total flux (total number of particles that entered the cell) as well as graphs of how many particles of each type are within the cell
